1. Implement React for More Dynamic Template, also because I wanted to brush up on React, also the bevy of libraries for further complicating this project :D
2. Switch from using Params to sending the JSON payload, as each form has n number of inputs, and I didn't want the logic to be a series of convoluted if statements (DRY anyone?)
3. All info is kept on a local JSON
