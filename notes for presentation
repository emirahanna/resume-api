1. Implement React for More Dynamic Template, also because I wanted to brush up on React, also the bevy of libraries for further complicating this project :D
2. Switch from using Params to sending the JSON payload, as each form has n number of inputs, and I didn't want the logic to be a series of convoluted if statements (DRY anyone?)
3. All info is kept on a local JSON
4. use useState for Reactive variables (in App.js)


1 huge difficulty was making things work with the lifecycle. having dynamic rendering is fun and games, until i had to actually pull out the information, hence useState was introduced
MAIN GOOD THING

changed from an api to a resume builder
react libraries
to pdf
material ui shit
